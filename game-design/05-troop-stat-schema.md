# Troop Stat Schema

## The Gist
Every troop is defined by a common **data schema** rather than hand-coded logic per
unit. A unit is built from:
1. A set of **tags** describing what it *is* (domain, category, traits).
2. A set of **base stats** (HP, damage, speed, etc).
3. A set of **modifier dictionaries** describing how it performs *against* other tags
   (bonus/penalty damage dealt, bonus/penalty damage received).
4. A set of **flags** for special behavior (can't attack, ignores a terrain rule, is
   stealthed, provides an aura, etc).

Because bonuses/weaknesses are expressed as "multiplier vs. tag" rather than a fixed
matchup table, adding a new unit later never requires editing existing units — you
just give the new unit its own tags and modifier entries, and every existing unit's
"vs tag" rules automatically apply to it if it shares a tag. This keeps the roster open
for future additions (Shield Tank, Stealth unit, etc.) without a redesign.

## Field-by-Field Explanation

### Identity
- **Domain** (`Infantry` / `Land` / `Air` / `Naval`) — which terrain/movement ruleset
  applies by default (see `01-map-and-terrain.md`). Determines base eligibility to
  cross forest/river/etc. before any per-unit overrides. **Infantry is its own Domain,
  not a tag under `Land`** — the terrain table in `01-map-and-terrain.md` already gives
  Infantry and Land Vehicles genuinely different default rules (Forest blocks Land
  Vehicles but not Infantry; Hills slow Infantry but not vehicles), so `Land` now means
  land *vehicles* specifically. This also means Domain doubles as a matchable key for
  the damage modifier dictionaries below, the same way tags do — see Damage Modifiers.
- **Category/Trait tags** (list, e.g. `[Vehicle, Tank, Heavy]`) — descriptive labels
  used purely so other units' modifier dictionaries can reference them. A unit can
  carry as many tags as make sense (e.g. Flamecopter might be `[Aircraft,
  Fire]`).

### Core Combat Stats
- **HP** — how much damage a unit can take before dying.
- **Armor** (number, default 0) — flat damage reduction applied to each incoming hit,
  after `damage_received_modifiers` are resolved, floored so a hit always deals at
  least 1 damage. Distinct from `damage_received_modifiers`, which is a multiplier
  rather than a flat subtraction — the two stack (multiplier first, then flat
  reduction). Bypassed entirely by an attacker whose `damage_types` include
  `Piercing` (see below). Introduced for **Shielder** (see `08-troop-roster.md`), a
  pure tank/meatshield with no attack of its own.
- **Damage** — base damage per attack, before any modifiers are applied.
- **Attack speed** — how often it attacks (attacks per time unit).
- **Range** — max distance at which it can engage a target. Deliberately separate
  from Vision range.
- **Splash radius** — 0 for single-target units; >0 applies damage to a radius around
  the impact point (e.g. Grenade Tower, Hot Air Balloon, Plasmacopter).
- **Vision range** — how far the unit can see, kept separate from Range so a unit can
  spot an enemy before being able to fight it (or vice versa), giving reaction time.

### Movement
- **Speed** — base movement rate, in **hexes per second** (not per tick — see
  `01-map-and-terrain.md`'s Movement & Positioning section for the exact per-tick
  formula, `(speed / terrainCostMultiplier) * tickDuration`; harder terrain divides
  effective speed down, it does not multiply it up).
- **Terrain overrides** — per-unit exception flags layered on top of the Domain's
  default terrain behavior. Example: Quad-bike is `Domain: Land`, which normally means
  "blocked by Forest," but carries `ignores_forest_block: true` to override just that
  one rule. This avoids rewriting terrain logic per unit — defaults come from Domain,
  exceptions come from flags.
- **Domain terrain defaults** (see `01-map-and-terrain.md`): `Infantry` — blocked by
  River (needs a Bridge), slowed by Hills, normal on Forest/Plains; `Land` (vehicles) —
  blocked by Forest (needs a Road) and River (needs a Bridge), normal on Hills/Plains;
  `Air` — ignores all terrain restrictions; `Naval` — Ocean/River only, disembarks only
  at a Dock/Port/Shipyard/Harbour.

### Targeting
- **can_target** (list of Domains/tags, e.g. `[Land, Naval]`) — a hard restriction on
  what a unit is even allowed to engage, independent of range. An empty list means the
  unit cannot attack at all (e.g. **Engineer**). This is how "Hot Air Balloon can't hit
  aircraft" and "some infantry can't hit aircraft" are both expressed with the same
  mechanism, rather than special-cased per unit.
- **Resolved: `Structure` is a reserved value** usable in `can_target` (and in the
  damage modifier dictionaries below), covering **buildings and walls uniformly,
  except Defensive-category buildings** — there's no separate "Building" vs. "Wall"
  target kind, since the ability to attack one implies the ability to attack the
  other. Most combat troops include `Structure` in `can_target` by default, since
  sieging buildings/HQs is core to the conquest win condition — **Sniper** is a
  deliberate exception that omits it (see `08-troop-roster.md`). A `Structure` target
  is auto-targeted by default just like an enemy troop or Defensive building, but at
  lower priority: default (undirected) auto-targeting picks the nearest enemy troop or
  Defensive building first, and only turns on the nearest Structure once none of those
  are in range (see `04-combat.md`). A directed order still lets a player commit a
  squad to a specific Structure regardless of what else is nearby.
- **Resolved: `Defensive` is a second reserved value**, split out from `Structure`,
  covering Defensive-category buildings specifically (Turret, Missile Launcher,
  Grenade Tower, Flame/Cold Turret, River Battery, Tower — matches
  `data/buildings/schema.json`'s `category: "Defensive"`). A troop must list
  `Defensive` separately from `Structure` to be able to target base defenses at all —
  e.g. **Basekiller** carries `can_target` including `Defensive` but not `Infantry`,
  and `damage_dealt_modifiers: { Defensive: 2.5 }` for a large bonus specifically vs.
  base defenses (see `08-troop-roster.md`).
  - **Resolved: `Defensive` sits at a higher default auto-target priority than plain
    `Structure`.** Defensive buildings actively shoot at troops in range, so any troop
    that lists `Defensive` in `can_target` will auto-engage a Defensive building on its
    own — same as it would an enemy troop — with **no explicit order needed**. Plain
    `Structure` (Farm, HQ, Barracks, walls, etc.) is also auto-targeted with no
    explicit order needed, but only once no enemy troop or Defensive building is in
    range (see below). An explicit directed order (see `04-combat.md`) still overrides
    this default the same way it overrides nearest-enemy-troop targeting.

### Squads & Siege Behavior
- **max_squad_size** (number, default a common baseline) — how many of this troop
  type can share one squad (see `07-data-architecture.md`'s `SquadInstance`). A
  freshly produced troop auto-joins the nearest same-type squad below this cap, or
  starts a new squad of 1. Set to **1** for troops that never merge (Engineer,
  Commander, Disruptor).
- **max_squads_led** (number, Commander-tagged troops only) — how many squads this
  Commander can lead as a **regiment** (baseline **4** — see `04-combat.md`).
- **commander_tier** (enum `common` / `rare` / `epic`, Commander-tagged troops only) —
  which Command Centre level unlocks this Commander: `common` at level 1, `rare` at
  level 2, `epic` at level 3 (all lower tiers stay unlocked at higher levels — see
  `02-bases-and-buildings.md`'s Command Centre & the Commander Cap section and
  `06-building-stats-and-defenses.md`). Not the same thing as `max_squads_led` — tier
  gates *which Commanders are trainable*, not how large their regiment is.
### Damage Modifiers (the "strong/weak against" system)
- Modifier dictionary keys can be **a Domain value, a descriptive tag, or a
  damage type** (see `damage_types` below) — all three are matched against the target
  the same way, so there's no separate mechanism needed for "vs a movement class" vs.
  "vs a descriptive trait" vs. "vs a kind of attack."
- **Damage dealt modifiers** (`{tag_or_domain: multiplier}`) — e.g. an anti-air unit
  might carry `{Air: 1.5}`, meaning it deals 1.5x its base damage to anything with
  Domain `Air`. **Grenadier** carries a `{Land: ...}` bonus (see
  `data/troops/grenadier.json` for the current multiplier) — a bonus against
  `Land`-domain targets (i.e. land vehicles) specifically, which does *not* apply to
  Air/Naval units even if they also happen to carry a `Vehicle` tag, and does not
  apply to Infantry (Infantry is a separate Domain, not part of `Land`). If a target's
  tags/domain don't match any entry, the multiplier defaults to 1.0 (no bonus/penalty).
  **Basekiller** carries `{Defensive: 2.5}` — a large bonus specifically vs.
  Defensive-category buildings, using the `Defensive` reserved key split out from
  `Structure` above.
- **Resolved: a multiplier entry doubles as a target-priority hint, proportional to
  the actual damage it changes.** The troop's default auto-targeting compares
  targets by their `damage_dealt_modifiers` product (matching entries multiply
  together, same as the real damage calculation) rather than just whether it clears
  1.0: a value **above** 1.0 is preferred over the neutral no-modifier default (e.g.
  Grenadier prefers a `Land`-domain target over an equally-near Rifleman, and
  **Basekiller** prefers the nearest Defensive building over any other Structure in
  range), while a value **below** 1.0 — a dampener, e.g. `0.5` — is deprioritized
  *below* that same neutral default rather than tied with it, since it deals
  strictly less damage. This only re-orders *which* in-range/allowed target is
  picked first; it doesn't expand `can_target` or override an explicit directed
  order (see `04-combat.md`).
- **Damage received modifiers** (`{tag_or_domain: multiplier}`) — the same idea from
  the receiving end. E.g. a Wood Wall might carry `{Fire: 2.0}`, taking double damage
  from any attacker whose `damage_types` includes `Fire`. A Turret might carry
  `{Air: 0.5}` (meaning it takes only half damage from air attackers) if that's a
  bonus you want towers to have vs. air raids.
- Both dictionaries stack multiplicatively with each other and with terrain/aura
  bonuses (consistent with the "bonuses stack" rule already established for base
  defenses).

### Damage Types (the "what kind of hit is this" label)
- **damage_types** (list, e.g. `[Fire]`, `[Piercing]`) — labels describing the nature
  of an attack, kept **separate from Category/Trait tags** so combat-relevant labels
  (which feed the modifier-matching system above) don't get mixed with purely
  descriptive/matchmaking tags (`Vehicle`, `Tank`, `Heavy`, etc.). A value here is
  matched against a target's `damage_received_modifiers` exactly like a Domain or tag
  — e.g. Flamethrower/Flame Turret carry `[Fire]`, which is what triggers a Wood
  Wall's `{Fire: 2.0}` entry.
- **Reserved value `Piercing`**: bypasses the target's flat `armor` stat (see
  below) — it does **not** bypass `damage_received_modifiers`, which continue to
  apply exactly like any other damage type (matched by key like Domain/tag/damage
  type). A target's `Fire`-keyed vulnerability doesn't fire off a `Piercing`
  attacker just because it's Piercing, and conversely a `Piercing`-keyed
  vulnerability still boosts a `Piercing` hit — bypassing modifiers outright would
  have let Piercing dodge a deliberately-authored weakness, so it only cancels
  `armor`. This is how **Sniper**'s "damage bypasses target armor" is expressed as
  data rather than a special case.
- **Splash is not a damage type.** It's a delivery mechanism, not a resistance label,
  and it's already fully expressed by the `splash_radius` field above — a splash
  attack can independently carry `damage_types: [Fire]` (or nothing at all) on top of
  its radius; the two are orthogonal.

### Detection & Stealth
- **stealth** (bool) — if true, the unit is invisible to enemies beyond its
  `reveal_range`.
- **reveal_range** — the distance at which a stealthed unit becomes visible to a normal
  (non-detector) enemy unit — i.e. "really close" per your description.
- **detector** (bool) — if true, this unit/building reveals stealthed units within its
  `detection_range` (or full normal vision range if `detection_range` is omitted),
  ignoring `reveal_range` entirely. Revealing means the stealthed unit becomes
  visible/targetable to ANY of the owning player's troops/buildings within that same
  local radius, not just the detector itself — Radar Array has no attack of its own, so
  its `detector` flag would be pointless unless it exposes the target to whatever else
  is nearby. Lets you design specific counter-play (build/bring a detector to
  neutralize enemy stealth) rather than making stealth uncounterable or trivially
  countered by everything.
- **detection_range** (number, optional) — overrides `detector`'s stealth-sight radius
  when it should differ from this unit/building's own vision range. Defaults to vision
  range if omitted (e.g. Sniper, Radar Array — both detect at their normal, full vision
  range). Tower is the first user of a real override: `detection_range: 3`, far short
  of its 12-tile vision range, so it clears fog-of-war widely but only spots cloaked
  units up close — a deliberate design choice keeping stealth detection tied to a short
  radius around a defended structure rather than granting long-range stealth-sight for
  free alongside ordinary vision (see `06-building-stats-and-defenses.md`'s Tower
  section).
- **reveals_on_attack** (bool) — if true, the unit's own stealth breaks the instant it
  attacks: it becomes visible to everyone (not just detectors or units within
  `reveal_range`), and stays visible until a few seconds pass without it attacking
  again, at which point it re-cloaks. Example: Ghost Tank (Signal Ridge) — see
  `02-bases-and-buildings.md`.

### Support Units
- **auras** (optional **list** of objects: `{radius, target, filter, effect,
  magnitude}`) — support units/buildings project a passive effect onto nearby units
  (or buildings) rather than (or in addition to) fighting directly. A unit/building
  can carry more than one aura at once. **target** says who the aura affects:
  - `friendly_troops` (default/most common) — e.g. Shield Tank →
    `{radius: 3, target: friendly_troops, effect: damage_reduction, magnitude: 20%}`.
  - `enemy_troops` — a debuff aura. E.g. Winter Forge's Ice Spire →
    `{radius: X, target: enemy_troops, effect: slow, magnitude: Y%}`.
  - `friendly_buildings` (optionally narrowed with **filter**, e.g. a specific
    building type) — a buff aimed at buildings rather than troops, e.g. `{radius:
    base-wide, target: friendly_buildings, filter: "Oil Rig", effect:
    production_boost, magnitude: Z%}`. Note: Ice Spire's Oil Rig boost and Shipyard's
    Harbour boost are NOT examples of this anymore — both were converted to base-wide
    `resourceModifiers` bonuses on their own `BaseDef` instead (see
    `03-resources.md`), so no building currently ships a `friendly_buildings` aura;
    this remains a valid pattern for a future one.
  - `enemy_buildings` (optionally narrowed with **filter**) — a debuff aimed at an
    enemy building's *function* rather than damaging it. E.g. Signal Ridge's
    Disruptor → `{radius: X, target: enemy_buildings, filter: "Defensive",
    effect: suppress_targeting}` — enemy Turrets/Missile Launchers/specialty defenses
    within radius stop firing while the Disruptor is alive; killing the Disruptor
    immediately restores them. This is why the Disruptor has to be escorted into range
    rather than sitting at its own base — unlike other auras, it only matters deep in
    enemy territory.
  - `upkeep_reduction` — a flat (not percent) reduction applied to **both**
    `foodUpkeep` and `fuelUpkeep` simultaneously, floored at 0 per troop. E.g. Camp
    Cozy's Mule → `{radius: 3, target: friendly_troops, effect: upkeep_reduction,
    magnitude: 3}` — an economic support aura (eases deficit pressure, see
    `03-resources.md`) rather than a combat-sustain one like Ambulance's
    `heal_over_time`.
  - `speed_boost` / `attack_speed_boost` — signed percent buffs to movement speed and
    attack speed respectively. E.g. Camp Cosy's Volt Truck buffs Land/Air/Naval troops
    (deliberately excluding Infantry) with a big `speed_boost` (40%) and a slight
    `attack_speed_boost` (15%). Since **filter** matches only one Domain/tag value at a
    time, a support unit covering multiple domains carries one aura entry per domain
    per effect rather than a single combined entry — Volt Truck carries six aura
    entries total (2 effects × 3 domains), see `data/troops/volt_truck.json`.
  - **Filter as Domain restriction**: beyond narrowing to a building type (Ice Spire's
    former Oil Rig example above), `filter` can also hold a Domain value to restrict a
    troop-targeted aura to one domain — e.g. Ambulance's `heal_over_time` now carries
    `filter: "Infantry"`, and Repair Truck's carries `filter: "Land"` (see
    `08-troop-roster.md`), splitting what used to be one Ambulance aura covering all
    troops into domain-specific support vehicles.
  Aura effects stack with terrain, wall, and other aura bonuses like everything else.

### Construction
- **can_build_infrastructure** (bool, default false) — if true, this unit can construct
  standalone Road/Bridge/Dock/Tower/Landmine (see `01-map-and-terrain.md` and
  `02-bases-and-buildings.md`). Only **Engineer** has this today; the buildable set
  itself is fixed rather than per-unit, so a single boolean is sufficient rather than
  a list like `can_target`/`cargo_allowed_tags`.

### Transport / Cargo
- **cargo_capacity** (number, 0 = cannot transport) — how many **squads** this troop
  can carry aboard it, not individual troop headcount — a boarding squad occupies
  exactly one slot regardless of its own size (see `07-data-architecture.md`'s
  `SquadInstance.cargoSquadIds`, which capacity is checked against directly).
  Confirmed carriers: **Aircraft Carrier** (Kraken Point Shipyard, capacity 2),
  **Tank Carrier** (Kraken Point Shipyard, capacity 2), **HMS Cuddles** (Port,
  capacity 1), and **Transport Truck** (Capital/Foundry Reach Factory, capacity 1).
- **cargo_allowed_tags** (list of Domains/tags) — what it's allowed to load, same
  mechanism as `can_target`. Aircraft Carrier carries `Air`-tagged troops; Tank Carrier
  carries `Land`/`Infantry`; HMS Cuddles and Transport Truck carry `Infantry` only.
- **can_launch_cargo_mid_combat** (bool) — **true** for Aircraft Carrier, Tank Carrier,
  and Transport Truck: cargo isn't just passive storage, it can be deployed mid-battle
  rather than only when idle/docked. **HMS Cuddles is the one exception** — `false`,
  must be idle/docked to unload.
- Fuel/upkeep for cargo while stored: aircraft aboard an Aircraft Carrier don't consume
  Fuel while docked — a distinct mechanic from the general "Fuel-free adjacent to an
  owned base" rule (see `03-resources.md`), not an application of it; the Carrier is
  the one unit that grants fuel-free storage away from an owned base's footprint.
- **Resolved: boarding/unloading are explicit orders** (`board` targeting a carrier
  squad; `unload` naming which boarded squad to deploy) — see `04-combat.md`'s Cargo
  section. A boarded squad keeps counting against its owner's global squad cap while
  aboard, and **if the carrier squad is destroyed while loaded, every boarded squad
  and its troops are destroyed along with it** — no survivors spill out.

### Status Effects (on-hit)
- **status_effect_on_hit** (optional object: `{type, duration, magnitude?, chance?}`) —
  some attacks apply a temporary condition to the target on a successful hit, separate
  from (or in addition to) direct damage. `chance` (percent, default 100) lets an
  effect be probabilistic rather than guaranteed — e.g. a 30% chance to apply per hit.
  This is the same "flags describe special behavior" pattern used elsewhere in the
  schema (stealth, terrain overrides) rather than a one-off case.
- **Freeze vs. Stun**: two distinct `type` values, not interchangeable names for the
  same effect:
  - **`freeze`** — full lockout only (target can't move or attack) for `duration`,
    nothing after. Example: Cold Turret (Winter Forge) → `{type: freeze, duration: ...}`
    (see `data/buildings/cold_turret.json` for the current duration).
  - **`stun`** — full lockout for `duration`, same as freeze, but **always** followed
    by a fixed trailing "dazed" debuff once the lockout ends: **-30% move speed and
    -30% attack speed, lasting the same length as the lockout itself (`duration`
    again, not a second number)**. This tail effect is a **global rule tied to the
    `stun` type itself, not a per-instance field** — the same pattern as HP regen being
    a global 5%-per-5s rule rather than a per-building stat (see
    `06-building-stats-and-defenses.md`). Any troop or defensive building using
    `{type: stun, ...}` gets the tail automatically, reusing whatever `duration` it
    already authored for the lockout — the schema doesn't need a separate field for
    the tail's length, only the -30%/-30% magnitude is fixed.
  - **`knockback`** — a third, structurally different `type`: an instantaneous
    displacement rather than a timed lockout. `magnitude` is the number of hexes the
    target is shoved directly away from the attacker; `duration` is unused/omitted (the
    effect resolves immediately, there's nothing to lock out or tail). No probabilistic
    convention differs either — same `chance` field, default 100. Example: Windy Peaks'
    Wind Spire → `{type: knockback, magnitude: 2}`, see `data/buildings/wind_spire.json`.
  - **`emp`** — a fourth `type`, domain-conditional rather than a single uniform
    effect (a new pattern — every other status effect so far applies the same way
    regardless of what it hits):
    - **Land domain** (vehicles): a partial, movement-only lockout — the target
      **cannot move** for `duration`, but **can still attack** if something is already
      in range. This is distinct from `freeze`'s full lockout (no movement *or*
      attack).
    - **Air domain**: **instant destroy** — the target is destroyed outright,
      regardless of remaining HP. `duration`/`magnitude` are unused for this branch;
      there's nothing to time or measure, it's a kill.
    - **Infantry and Naval domains**: **no effect at all** — direct damage from the
      hit still applies as normal, just no status effect.
    - **`empImmune` troops are unaffected by either branch** (see
      `data/troops/schema.json`) — currently Hot Air Balloon and Glider, both
      unpowered/non-electronic exceptions to the rest of the Air-domain roster.
      Example: Signal Ridge's EMP Turret → `{type: emp, duration: 3}`, see
      `data/buildings/emp_turret.json`.

### Upgrades
- **Troops cannot be upgraded** once trained. A unit's stats are fixed for its
  lifetime — getting access to stronger units comes from capturing/unlocking new
  production buildings or better unit types within an existing building's roster, not
  from upgrading individual troops. This is the opposite of buildings, which *can* be
  upgraded (see `06-building-stats-and-defenses.md`).

### Economy
- **Cost** (dict per resource — Food/Steel/Stone/Fuel as relevant) — one-time cost to
  produce the unit.
- **Food upkeep** — ongoing Food consumption while the unit exists.
- **Fuel upkeep** — ongoing Fuel consumption; rules differ by Domain (land
  vehicles: only while moving; aircraft: constant unless idle and on/adjacent to one
  of the *owner's own* bases (never an enemy's or neutral one); ships: minimal
  regardless of state — see `03-resources.md`).
- **Production time** — troop training is **not instant** (unlike building
  construction). This is why a base can build multiple copies of the same production
  building (e.g. two Barracks = double infantry output) — each building has its own
  independent queue and its own production-time countdown per unit.

## Full Schema Reference (implementation-ready shape)

| Terrain overrides | flags | e.g. `ignores_forest_block` |
| can_target | list of tags | empty list = non-combat (e.g. Engineer); reserved value `Structure` covers buildings+walls EXCEPT Defensive-category buildings, auto-targeted by default once no enemy troop/Defensive building is in range; reserved value `Defensive` covers those separately, must be listed to be attackable, and takes priority over plain `Structure` — auto-targeted by default like an enemy troop, no order needed |

| max_squads_led | number | Commander-tagged troops only; baseline 4 |
| commander_tier | enum: common/rare/epic | Commander-tagged troops only; which Command Centre level unlocks this Commander (see `02-bases-and-buildings.md`) |
| Damage dealt modifiers | dict `{tag_or_domain: multiplier}` | "strong against"; key may be a Domain value (e.g. `Land`), a tag, a damage type, or `Structure`/`Defensive`; any entry above 1.0 also acts as a target-priority hint (see Damage Modifiers section) |
| Damage received modifiers | dict `{tag_or_domain: multiplier}` | "weak against"; key may be a Domain value, a tag, or a damage type |
| damage_types | list | e.g. `[Fire]`, `[Piercing]`; matched against damage received modifiers same as any other value (no bypass — `Piercing` instead bypasses the target's flat Armor, see above); splash is NOT a damage type (see splash_radius) |
| stealth | bool | |
| reveal_range | number | distance at which stealth breaks vs. non-detectors |
| detector | bool | sees stealth at detection_range, or full vision range if detection_range is omitted |
| detection_range | number | optional; overrides detector's stealth-sight radius when shorter than normal vision range (e.g. Tower) |

## Example Units Under This Schema (illustrative, not final stats)

**Engineer**
- Domain: Land · Tags: `[Vehicle, Support]`
- can_target: `[]` (cannot attack)
- Special: only unit that can build Roads/Bridges/Docks; Factory level-1 unlock

**Hot Air Balloon**
- Domain: Air · Tags: `[Aircraft, Balloon]`
- can_target: `[Land, Naval]` (cannot target Air)
- Splash radius: high · Range: low · Speed: slow
- Fuel upkeep: modest (lighter than most aircraft)

**Glider** (Windy Peaks' Wind Sanctuary)
- Domain: Air · Tags: `[Aircraft, Scout]`
- can_target: `[]` (cannot attack — pure scout, like Engineer)
- Vision range: high · Speed: fast · Cost: cheap
- Fuel upkeep override: unpowered, so it uses **Food** upkeep instead of the Air
  domain's usual heavy Fuel upkeep — another example of a per-unit flag overriding a
  Domain default, same pattern as Quad-bike's terrain override below.

**Quad-bike**
- Domain: Land · Tags: `[Vehicle, Light]`
- Terrain override: `ignores_forest_block: true`
- HP/Damage: low (fragile, fast scout/harassment unit)

**Transport Truck** (Capital Factory)
- Domain: Land · Tags: `[Vehicle, Support]`
- can_target: `[]` or minimal (little/no attack — see `08-troop-roster.md`)
- cargo_capacity: > 0 · cargo_allowed_tags: `[Infantry]` · can_launch_cargo_mid_combat: true

**Aircraft Carrier** (Kraken Point Shipyard)
- Domain: Naval · Tags: `[Ship, Carrier]`
- cargo_capacity: > 0 · cargo_allowed_tags: `[Air]` · can_launch_cargo_mid_combat: true
- Docked aircraft use no Fuel while stored — its own mechanic, distinct from the
  general "Fuel-free adjacent to an owned base" rule (see `03-resources.md`)

**Shield Tank** (future/planned)
- Domain: Land · Tags: `[Vehicle, Tank, Support]`
- aura: `{radius: 3, effect: damage_reduction, magnitude: 20%}`

**Stealth Unit** (implemented — Ghost Tank, Submarine, Sniper)
- stealth: true · reveal_range: short
- Countered specifically by units/buildings with `detector: true`
